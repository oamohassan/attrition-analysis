# attrition-analysis
 An analysis of employee attrition on an artificial HR dataset.
 Notebook language: Dutch.
 
 This analysis was a graduation project from the school of data science, where I completed a 5 week course in Data Science. I focused on python, machine learning, statistics and other valuable skills within data analysis. I tried to show them off here.
